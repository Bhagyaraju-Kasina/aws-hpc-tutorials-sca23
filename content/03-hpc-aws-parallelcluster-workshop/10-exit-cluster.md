Congratulations, you have deployed a HPC Cluster on AWS !

In this lab, you have:
- Configured your HPC Cluster
- Deployed a HPC Cluster in the cloud.
- Run a sample application on your HPC Cluster.

In the next lab, you will learn how to interact with the new AWS ParallelCluster API using Python and through an open-source GUI called the *Pcluster Manager*.

You can learn more about AWS ParallelCluster by visiting the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/what-is-aws-parallelcluster.html).
