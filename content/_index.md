Amazon Web Services provides the most elastic and scalable cloud infrastructure to run your [Weather applications](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/). With virtually unlimited capacity, engineers, researchers, and HPC system owners can innovate beyond the limitations of on-premises HPC infrastructure.

HPC on AWS removes the long wait times and lost productivity often associated with on-premises HPC clusters. Flexible configuration and virtually unlimited scalability allow you to grow and shrink your infrastructure as your workloads dictate, not the other way around. Additionally, with access to a broad portfolio of cloud-based services like Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), you can redefine traditional NWP workflows to innovate faster.

Some of our NWP customers include:
