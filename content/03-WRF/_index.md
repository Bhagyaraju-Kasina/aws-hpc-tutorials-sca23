In this section of the lab we'll setup [Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/what-we-offer/models/weather-research-and-forecasting-model-wrf) from NCAR. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is a next-generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications.

It's easy to install with the package manager Spack.

To do so we've broken it down into the following steps:

1. Install WRF with Spack
2. Download CONUS 12km model
