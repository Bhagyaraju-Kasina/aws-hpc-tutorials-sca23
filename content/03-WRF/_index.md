In this section of the lab we'll setup a cluster and install [Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/what-we-offer/models/weather-research-and-forecasting-model-wrf) from NCAR. To do so we've broken it down into the following steps:

1. Setup AWS ParallelCluster
2. Install Spack
3. Install WRF with Spack
4. Download CONUS 12km model
